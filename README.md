# DSA-Study-Tool
Help to study for Data Structures and Algorithms 

Have you ever felt braindead when trying to study and learn DSA?

This is the solution!

What it is:

    -This is a DSA training bot that will give you coding questions from websites such as Leetcode to help you practice the application of DSA
    -It will first take a survey from the user to see what the user is cabable of, this will be a 15 question mulitple choice with a coding question at the end
    -Then using the answers the user has provided it will go on to give a level to the user of what they are predicted to know based on the questions they got correct
    -It will also analyze their code to then see if they are able to do the most efficient way to complete the problem they are given
    -Going from here it will then give a structured course on what the user should study and know while also giving them content questions to see if they are learning
    -With this the more the user seems to retain the higher up the ranking system they will go ultimately being more than able to solve harder interview questions while also explaining their answers and the background behind them
